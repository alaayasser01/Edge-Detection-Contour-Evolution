# Image Processing Project
### For detailed insights and additional examples, please refer to the report file in the repository.

## Overview

This repository showcases a variety of image processing techniques implemented in Python using the OpenCV library with a streamlit application. The project covers several key algorithms, each addressing different aspects of image analysis and manipulation.

## Lines & circles Detection using Hough Transform

The Hough Transform is employed for detecting lines in images. The process involves utilizing the Canny edge detection algorithm and adjusting thresholds to control the detected lines. 
The section also explores Hough Transform for circle detection, emphasizing the importance of selecting suitable thresholds and radius ranges.

## Ellipse Detection Algorithm

The implemented ellipse detection algorithm is based on the work by Xie and Ji. It identifies ellipse parameters by analyzing pairs of pixels assumed to be on the major axis. The algorithm is sensitive to threshold and accuracy parameters, making it crucial to fine-tune for optimal results.

## Contouring using Active Contour

The active contour function leverages the Sobel operator and energy functions to identify and track contours in images. Users can initiate contours with circles, squares, or manually.
